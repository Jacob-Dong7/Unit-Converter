<h1>Unit Converter</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project is a C++ unit converter built in Visual Studio using Qt and Qt Designer. It supports multiple unit types, including length, weight, temperature, and static currency rates, all accessible through a clean GUI. Users select categories and units from dropdown menus, enter values in input fields, and instantly see the converted result. A key feature is the persistent conversion history: every conversion is logged and saved to a file, allowing users to review past calculations across sessions.
